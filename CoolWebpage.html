	<p class="i">Because Why Not? </p>
	<h2> Why I love the Mother Series </h2>
	<p>The music, storytelling, and humor are all to take note of- and the art too! That concludes this section.</p>
	<h2> Will MOTHER 3 Ever be Localized? </h2>
	<p> Probably not, though there is hope, as Shantae Advance, lost media until recently, was released 22 years later.</p>
	<h2> So You Like UNDERTALE? </h2>
	<p> Toby Fox, creator of Undertale, is a huge fan of  Earthbound (MOTHER 2). His earliest work was Earthbound Halloween Hack, containing the iconic "Megalovania" as the final boss theme. <p>
	<h2> What is that Favicon? </h2>
	<p> If you are using the FIREFOX browser, then you will see a certain animation that has taken the internet by storm, "Bad Apple". If not, you will see a still white image.
